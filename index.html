            <p>Happy Birthday Tiffany &#9829; <br>
                Another year has gone by where I have been blessed
                to have you. <br>
                Another year has gone by where I had the privilege
                to cherish you. <br>
                Another year has gone by where I got to love you. <br>
                Another year, Another year... Another year.<br>
                <br>
                Another year has passed with you in my heart. <br>
                Another year has passed with your smile lighting up a room <br>
                Another year has passed with your footsteps gracing this Earth <br>
                Another year, Another year... Another year.<br>
                <br>
                Another year has strolled by with your laughter sending music to my ears. <br>
                Another year has strolled by with your voice being the reason for my excitement <br>
                Another year has strolled by with your presence being my blessing. <br>
                Another year, Another year... Another year.<br>
                <br>
                Another year has swept us by with you as my bestfriend. <br>
                I smile at the thought of next year's birthday being another year with you by my side. <br>
